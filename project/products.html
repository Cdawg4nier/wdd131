            <h3>Gode: Rogue</h3>
            <p id="section-4-p">Gode: Rogue is a 20-45 minute Deckbuilding strategy game for 1 to 6 players. Players
                will take turns playing cards from their hand on their turn to acquire resources, such as gold, card
                draws, or extra card plays, and then spending those resources to recruit powerful mercenaries from a
                shop.
                Their goal will be to gather enough combat power on their turn to overpower and defeat an automata boss,
                which is recruiting mercenaries and adding them to a deck of its own.</p>
